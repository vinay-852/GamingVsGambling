Most idle games are flat and 2D, which is fine, but this game just blows them out of the water. The graphics are nothing advanced, but the 3D environment and models just make it better. You are not required to buy anything to advance at a fair pace, and any extra penguins you can purchase are just for decoration. 5/5 Would recommend\",\n",

Although I accidentally went ahead on a quest and now I can't continue my quests, but I don't care. This is the best game of all time, It doesn't shove adds in your face, the only adds in it are only if you want extra rewards, its simple and easy, its super fun, Easy five star rating for me. I'd suggest downloading this.\",\n",

The other habitats take on average 172 times longer for an upgrade to pay for itself than the first two habitats. This is calculated after upgrading all the 17 habitats so that all their upgrade costs are in the range 178bf to 184bf gold, and their evolution costs are all 1o hearts except the flower farm which is 2o hearts (because it always costs double the others to evolve at any given price scale).

The main reason in my opinion is the amount of hearts you get. By using time token you get the amount of gold, but no hearts included. If time tokens would also give hearts it would be fantastic, or you could make separate time token for hearts. The only way to progress at this stage is through research, which is getting harder and harder.\",\n",

You can tell the devs keep constantly putting in work to make the game better. Penguin Isle uses the microtransactions monetisation system with seasonal passes, however it's not required to spend a single dime on the game to enioy it fully. Big respect to the devs and hope the team working on this stays well and healthy.\",\n",
